simple desktops scraper

I wanted to quickly download all the simple desktops. They're just so pretty. I threw some code together. You might find it useful too.

Just do:

  python simpledesktopsscraper.py clone

and it will download everything into your present working directory. There are theoretically other features but I haven't bothered to implement them yet.

Use at your own peril.
